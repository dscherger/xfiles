The following issues are known to exist and may or may not be fixed any time soon.

Open, Deleted and Renamed Files

Although the vcs may report a file as deleted it will not generally appear in
the tool window. The problem is that the filter runs over the list of current
project files and includes those that match the filter criteria. Deleted files
no longer exist and will not be tested against the currently selected filter.

File deletion events that occur while the tool window is active should be detected
and their associated files should be tested against the currently selected
filter so they may be visible. The same situation exists for renamed files
as the file no longer exists under the old name. Rename events should be detected
in the same way and my be visible.

A filter that selects open files will currently include files that are opened
while the tool window is active regardless of whether the file exists in the
project or not. For example, "files" from the jdk source jar that are opened
will be selected by an open filter. However, refreshing the filter will exclude
these files because they are not listed in the project source roots.

There are a few different ways to solve these problems. One would be to only
ever list files in the project source roots which would require an initial
check that any file is in one of the project source roots. Another would be
to include all project roots such that library sources would always be included.
(further investigation required)
