     * - need connections between list of filters, filter selection, filter configuration,

     * - filter configuration
     *      - add/edit/delete filters to list of configured filters
     * - filter selection
     *      - change currently selected filter
     *      - execute selected filter when selection changes
     * - filter execution
     *      - execute currently selected filter
