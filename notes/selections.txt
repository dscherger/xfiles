the basic idea is for the xfiles panel to list files according to various
configurable selections. examples might be things like:

open files

	- ask FileEditorManager isFileOpen(VirtualFile file)

changed files
unknown files
added files
deleted files
missing files

	- ask FileStatusManager for status and seeing if it's
	  not modified (or perhaps in some selected list of status values)

module's files

	- compare module.getName() to specified glob

source files
test files
java files
non-java files

	- ask ProjectFileIndex isInSource() isInTest(), isJavaSourceFile()
	- ask FileTypeManager about types perhaps too?

consider use cases from work where we want a notes view listing files in the
notes module, a changed files view, a *Entry classes view, a *Transaction
classes view, a *Assessor view, etc.

ui for configuring filter needs something like the following:

module		selected/any
editor status	open/closed/any
file status	unknown/ignored/missing/changed/added/deleted/unchanged/any
file type	soure/test/java/text/any
file name	glob

seems like several checkbox groups for this

xfiles panel then needs a combobox that lists configured selections by name
and allows for switching selection (view) or editing the view configurations.
consider the junit test configuration panel as an example, listing the known
configurations and allowing them to be sorted, added, deleted, edited, etc.

in terms of sorting probably by file type, then name with little endian class
name sort for java class files

it would be somewhat nice to also allow for a combobox on the main toolbar
that lists open files 

questions for jetbrains

	- adding a combobox action
	- using globbing on file/class/method names
	- is getting a list of java files with compiler errors possible?

	- getting list of all file status values?
	- where is the none selection of displayed editor tabs headed?

	- using the commit project things?
	- annotations

suggestions for more perforce integrations

	- merging resolving? (should probably test this)
	- persistent list of files in named changelists
	- error message on commit when currently selected changelist has
	  already been submitted
	- some other way that commit to get into project diff panel

filter configuration component

	- list of named filters
	- add/drop/copy/move up/move down on list
	- name: ___
	- module: _ aaa _ bbb _ ccc			(checkboxes)
	- editor: _ open _ closed			(checkboxes)
	- vcs status: _ unknown _ ignored ...		(checkboxes and named vcs)
	- file classification: _ source _ test _ java _ text	(checkboxes not FileType instances perhaps classification)
	- file type: _ java _ text _ ...		(checkboxes FileType instances)
	- file name: ______				(glob)
	- compile status: _ ok _ errors			(checkboxes)
	- sort: type, name, status, module, ...		(table with sortable columns?)
	- sync editor with selected files?		(single checkbox)
	- ok, cancel, apply, help buttons
